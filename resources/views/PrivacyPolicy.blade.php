        as information that you provide during a registration process or at other times while using the <span
            id="span_id_type">Website</span>, as described above).</p>
    <p>For example, we use cookies to make your browsing experience easier and more intuitive: cookies are small
        strings of text used to store some information that may concern the user, his or her preferences or the
        device they are using to access the internet (such as a computer, tablet, or mobile phone). Cookies are
        mainly used to adapt the operation of the site to your expectations, offering a more personalized browsing
        experience and memorizing the choices you made previously.</p>
    <p>A cookie consists of a reduced set of data transferred to your browser from a web server and it can only be
        read by the server that made the transfer. This is not executable code and does not transmit viruses.</p>
    <p>Cookies do not record or store any Personal Data. If you want, you can prevent the use of cookies, but then
        you may not be able to use our <span id="span_id_type">Website</span> as we intend. To proceed without
        changing the options related to cookies, simply continue to use our <span id="span_id_type">Website</span>.
